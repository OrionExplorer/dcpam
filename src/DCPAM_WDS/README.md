## Purpose of DCPAM WDS
DCPAM WDS is dedicated endpoint for querying predefined business data with custom caching system. DCPAM does not limit number of virtual and physical DCPAM Database nodes, therefore DCPAM WDS encapsulates every node of DCPAM Database into single data access point.

## Technology
### Architecture Overview
* Server application dedicated for the backends of client applications.
* Connections accepted from allowed hosts only with valid API key.
* JSON-based communication with client applications.
* Builds the in-memory cache for queries predefined in `wds_config.json` on startup:
    * For one or more DCPAM Database nodes.
* Caches data on the fly for new requests.
* Maximum allowed memory usage configuration.
* May need a lot of RAM.

### Data sources
DCPAM development is still in progress with following data sources available:

#### Databases
| Data source                        | Support          |
|:-----------------------------------|:----------------:|
| PostgreSQL                         | native           |
| MySQL 8                            | native           |
| MariaDB/MySQL 5                    | native           |
| SQL Server/Azure SQL Database      | native via ODBC* |
| Oracle Database                    | native           |
| SQLite3                            | native           |
| IBM Db2                            | ODBC             |

> \* SQL Server/Azure SQL Database: [ODBC is the primary native data access API for applications written in C and C++ for SQL Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/odbc/microsoft-odbc-driver-for-sql-server).

**Please note that DCPAM provides support for every ODBC-compliant data source**.

#### Flat Files
| Data source                        | Support          |
|:-----------------------------------|:----------------:|
| CSV                                | native           |
| TSV                                | native           |
| PSV                                | native           |
| JSON                               | native           |

DCPAM can access files from local or remote locations. The latter are fetched via HTTP protocol and [Battery HTTP Server](https://github.com/OrionExplorer/battery-http-server) is recommended.
Files are loaded to temporary tables in DCPAM or external database to make SQL operations possible for this kind of data.

### DCPAM Database
DCPAM is designed to be as most customizable as it needs to be.
Therefore every database listed above as available data source can also be used as DCPAM target database.

### Configuration
For DCPAM WDS `wds_config.json` is the main configuration file. It defines:
* DCPAM database.
* Tables and views (see _app.DATA_), where integrated data is stored.

#### Docker image
> Build DCPAM WDS image `dcpam-wds`:
```
> docker build -t dcpam-wds:latest . --file dcpam-wds.dockerfile
```
> Run DCPAM WDS with mapped `wds_config.json`:
```
> docker run -ti -v /home/dcpam/conf/wds_config.json:/opt/dcpam/conf/wds_config.json --rm dcpam-wds:latest
```

#### Compilation (Linux)
> Before attempt to compile, please adjust `ORACLE_DEP` paths in `makefile`.
```
> make dcpam-wds
```
- run DCPAM WDS
```
> ./dcpam-wds
```
- run with Valgrind (with suppression of Oracle OCI errors) and default `wds_config.json`.
```
> valgrind --leak-check=full --show-reachable=yes --error-limit=no --suppressions=valgrind_oci.supp ./dcpam-wds
```
- run with Valgrind and `wds_config_mysql.json` (where MySQL is DCPAM main database)
```
> valgrind --leak-check=full --show-reachable=yes --error-limit=no ./dcpam-wds wds_config_mysql.json
```
