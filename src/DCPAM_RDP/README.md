## Purpose of DCPAM RDP
DCPAM RDP is used by DCPAM-ETL to execute scripts/applications for data transformation located on the remote servers. It is often used when performance hit caused by these computations may impact other ongoing operations (ie. data extraction/load or user queries).

## Technology
### Architecture Overview
* Data transformation:
  * fully supported, but not required in the ETL/ELT process
  * possibility to run outside the DCPAM server

![Architecture overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OrionExplorer/dcpam/master/docs/rdp.png)
Example of DCPAM Transform process scalability:
* Multiple DCPAM ETL engine nodes can be run within single Data Warehouse.
* Each DCPAM ETL instance can trigger unlimitend number of local and remote (through DCPAM RDP) data transformation scripts/applications.
* Each DCPAM ETL instance can use dedicated Staging Area node (local or remote).
* Many DCPAM Database nodes can be encapsulated into single data access point by DCPAM WDS.
* DCPAM ETL, Staging Area, DCPAM Database and DCPAM WDS can run on single server as well!

#### Compilation (Linux)
> Before attempt to compile, please adjust `ORACLE_DEP` paths in `makefile`.
```
> make dcpam-rdp
```
- run DCPAM RDP
```
> ./dcpam-rdp
```
- run with Valgrind (with suppression of Oracle OCI errors)
```
> valgrind --leak-check=full --show-reachable=yes --error-limit=no --suppressions=valgrind_oci.supp ./dcpam-rdp
```
