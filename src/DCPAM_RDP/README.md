## Purpose of DCPAM RDP
DCPAM RDP is used by DCPAM-ETL to execute scripts/applications for data transformation located on the remote servers. It is often used when performance hit caused by these computations may impact other ongoing operations (ie. data extraction/load or user queries).

## Technology
### Architecture Overview
* Server application dedicated for DCPAM ETL requests.
* Connections accepted from allowed hosts only with valid API key.
* DCPAM ETL provides all the information about Staging Area and source system databases, so backflow of cleaned data is possible.

![Architecture overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OrionExplorer/dcpam/master/docs/rdp.png)
Example of DCPAM Transform process scalability:
* Multiple DCPAM ETL engine nodes can be run within single Data Warehouse.
* Each DCPAM ETL instance can trigger unlimitend number of local and remote (through DCPAM RDP) data transformation scripts/applications.
* Each DCPAM ETL instance can use dedicated Staging Area node (local or remote).
* Many DCPAM Database nodes can be encapsulated into single data access point by DCPAM WDS.
* DCPAM ETL, Staging Area, DCPAM Database and DCPAM WDS can run on single server as well!

#### Docker image
> Build DCPAM RDP image `dcpam-rdp`:
```
> docker build -t dcpam-rdp:latest . --file dcpam-rdp.dockerfile
```
> Run DCPAM RDP with mapped `rdp_config.json`:
```
> docker run -ti -v /home/dcpam/conf/rdp_config.json:/opt/dcpam/conf/rdp_config.json --rm dcpam-rdp:latest
```

#### Compilation (Linux)
> Before attempt to compile, please adjust `ORACLE_DEP` paths in `makefile`.
```
> make dcpam-rdp
```
- run DCPAM RDP
```
> ./dcpam-rdp
```
- run with Valgrind (with suppression of Oracle OCI errors)
```
> valgrind --leak-check=full --show-reachable=yes --error-limit=no --suppressions=valgrind_oci.supp ./dcpam-rdp
```
